# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
### The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the theater outcomes based on launch date and the play outcomes based on goals. The main goal was to uncover trends within the data to draw conclusions.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The above chart is based off of a pivot table where I analyzed how many successful, failed, and canceled theater kickstarters there were organized by month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The above chart is based off a new worksheet I created where I analyzed the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled kickstarter plays there were based off their goals.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The only challenge I encountered for "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" was when I was making the pivot table, I had to switch my row data from Date Ended Conversion to Date Created Conversion in order to show the correct data before creating the above chart.

The main challenge I encountered when performing the "Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals" was that it was time consuming to initially enter all of my COUNTIFS functions into my first column. From there, I was able to copy the function over the rows and only changed the outcome criteria.

## Results

- The first conclusion I can draw about the Outcomes Based on Launch Date is that theater kickstarters were most successful in May. The second conclusion I can draw is that theater kickstarters were the least successful in December.
- According on the Outcomes Based on Goals chart, I can conclude that plays were the most successful when their goal was less than 1000. We can also conclude that plays failed the most when their goal was over 40,000 and less than 45,000.
- Some limitations of this dataset is that the first chart only contains data regarding theater kickstarters and the second chart only contains data for play kickstarters. Our original data set contains information for over 40 different subcategories, so therefore there is a lot more analysis to be done to get a better grasp on all of our data. 
- Another possible graph that could be made would be a pie chart showing amount of successful, failed, canceled, and live kickstarters based on different subcategories. We could also make a bar graph regarding average donations to see which kickstarters have gained the most support which would definitely help Louise.
